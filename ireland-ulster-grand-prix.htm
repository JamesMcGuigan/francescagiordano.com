<p class='photobike'>In 1996 I raced in the the Ulster Grand Prix with the Yamaha YZF 750. I didn't finish the first race due to a clutch problem, but was able to return and finish in the second race of the day.</p>

<p class='photobike'> I cannot find any photos of the event, except this one with Nick. If anybody has any, then please <a href='mailto:$email'>let me know</a>.</p>
