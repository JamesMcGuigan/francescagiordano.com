The annual pilgrimage to the Isle of Man for the TT races is in full swing, with bikes and bikers everywhere.

ON TUESDAY afternoon, the mist came down on Snaefell, the highest mountain on  | the Isle of Man, and settled into  ; its folds like a damp, discarded blanket. This is the cloak of Manannan, drawn over the island to hide it from foreign invaders, yet while a thousand years of Manx independence suggest that the Celtic sea god once knew what he was doing, these days he seems to be fighting a losing battle. On the sea front at Douglas, the invaders were gathering in their thousands. A two-wheeled army of pilgrimage, undeterred by such sombre camouflage or the prospect of hotels where elegance is mostly of the faded variety. A multi-national throng, too,  pouring from the ferry King Orry to pay homage to legends of their own. The Manx authorities call their island the road-race capital of the world, yet even in practice week their claim seemed flawed by an excess of modesty. As sacred as they are celebrated, the 37.73 miles of its Tourist Trophy circuit formed by the simple expedient of closing a few public roads lure 500 competitors and 40,000 spectators every year, drawn, by a beguiling mixture of history, tradition and the purity of the sport. To think of it merely as a sporting venue is to miss the point by a distance. You only have to drive round the course once to appreciate that the roadside marker boards form the most evocative gazetteer in motorcycle racing. West. out of Douglas, the road takes you past Braddon Bridge and Crosby then north from Ballacraine. Past Cronk-y-Voddy, Ballaugh Bridge and Selby, it then loops south from Ramsey over the famous Mountain section. The ascent is relatively gentle, but the downward sweep is a furious and exhilarating charge through the bends of Windy Corner and Creg-ny-Baa and on to Governor's Bridge, the last of the circuit's 264 corners on the .en-... try to the finishing straight. ' By any measure, not least the fact that it has claimed around   Girl on a motorcycle: Giordano has gained in confidence since crashing into a wall on her first visit.

160 lives since racing began in 1911 - and another four last week - it is a challenging course. After all the Bloodbath Island headlines of recent years, the organisers are prickly to the point of paranoia, pointing out that, with 400,000 racing miles every year, its record is no worse than others. Yet even they recognise that the most difficult corner on the course is its learning curve, and newcomers to the island are granted the concessions of slower qualifying times. Francesca Giordano, who will compete in tomorrow's lightweight race and in the Junior TT on Wednesday, first came to the island in 1993. Her inexperience was exposed when she fell from her bike during practice, slid 30 yards into a wall, and had to be taken to hospital. She ended up in a neck brace, but still competed the following week, albeit chastened by the experience. She knows now that the course deserves respect. "If you are used to circuit racing and you come here, where there are telegraph poles and walls everywhere, you tend to go a little slowly at first. It takes a lot of time to learn. But now I know the places where I can go faster. I am getting used to the speed in those streets where my instincts tell me to go slowly, but I still need as much practice as possible." As one of only three women entrants, and one, of only two Italians, Francesca Giordano is hardly the typical TT competitor. Yet it. is argu

able whether such a creaturereally exists, for outside theselect few stars, the rest of theTT field is drawn from animpressively wide range ofbackgrounds and nationalities,enthusiasm being their onlycommon factor. Behind thegrandstand are a handful ofworks teams with their motorhomes and liveried lorries, butthe most common transport by far is the hired van of theprivateer.            

 Clearly, part of the appeal ofthe TT is that it forms such abroad church. Yet this is an institution founded on democraticprinciples where, in a paddockmercifully free of the caste systems found in other forms ofmotorsport, it takes an experteye to distinguish the established hero from the optimisticnewcomer. While otherforssuffer from cynical elitism,road racing is still a healthymeritocracy, its machinerymore closely based on production machines and its stars almost invariably people'schampions, hailed for theirexpertise on roads that are opento everyone else almost everyday of they year.

on the island in 1979, whengrand prix stars like Sheene andAgostini turned their backs onthe event.

' The TT is the most beautiful race in the world," saysGiordano. "It's what everymotorcyclist would like to do- going as fast as possible onthe road. When you ride hereyou find that all the world hascome to watch the races. Youknow of the famous people whohave raced here before. Everypart of the island has a story andyou feel that you are a part of it.It's very fascinating, more thanjust a race."

While the course itself inspires awe and respect amongriders, it angers Giordano thatits killer reputation has beenbolstered by recklessness, bothof TT followers, who have triedto match their speeds, and bypress coverage that has failed todistinguish their deaths fromthose of real racers. Jack Wood,clerk of the course and a TTrider in the 1950s, understandsthe allure, but cautions newcomers against excess.

"Here you've got to be athinking rider, very much so,because of the nature of thecourse. With hedges and wallsand all the rest of it, it's acourse not to fall off on. A lotof the kerbs are chamfered, buteverything beyond that is a danger area. It's a hard course andit takes time to learn and it's unusual for anyone to go well onhis first year.

"If someone is going fastwe'd be worried about it, we'dbe talking to him about it infact. We'd want to know if herealised he was on the TTcourse and if he really knewwhat he was doing. The pleasure of riding here is so greatthat you can get obsessed withit and forget about other factors. We just like to stop themand make them think."

The charm of the Isle of Manis mirrored by a course, andweather conditions, of beguiling variety. This week, as theriders blast away from the startline, head down Bray Hill andover Quarter Bridge, they willsay a quiet prayer for a circuitfree of Mannanan's cloak, orany other shroud.
