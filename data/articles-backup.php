<p>SHE could be strutting her stuff on the Paris catwalk or reclining on a rock to model fashion swimwear.</p>

<p>She could, like her sister, Domiziana, have used her tumbling brunette curls, stunning figure and dazzling smile to launch herself as an actress.</p>

<p>But Francesca Romana Giordano chose to shun the glamour life. She prefers to drape herself across the fuel tank of a motorbike and open the throttle to hit l00mph in less time than it takes to read the opening paragraphs of this article.</p>

<p>For the fast lady from Italy has a dream - to become the first woman to win over the high-speed, high-risk Isle of Man TT circuit.</p>

<p>Unsupported by the heavy sponsorship enjoyed by her rivals, but fuelled by her love of speed since childhood, Francesca lines up in the lightweight 400 and junior 600 events on Monday and Wednesday next week.</p>

<p>Today, though, she will be crawling happily at 30mph through the English country-side, with caravan and two high-powered Yamaha motorbikes in tow as she makes her way to Douglas.</p>

<p>Her first appearance there four years ago almost ended in tragedy when she lost control of her 400cc Kawasaki in practice and crashed into a wall.</p>

<p>Unconscious, she was taken to hospital but recovered enough to try "in vain" to persuade doctors to let her out of their care for another stab at the twisting, 37-mile circuit,</p>

<p>She claims to have no fear of the risks - "ants frighten me more," she says - yet she carries the scars of the day she broke a kneecap as a 16-year-old when she crashed her Vespa in Rome.</p>

<p>Worse still, five years ago she broke 10 ribs and had two plates and 12 bolts inserted in her shattered left arm after a pile-up on a 125cc bike.</p>

<p>'That was worrying, not the crash but the four months' racing I missed!' she says. 'I have always found my love of winning much stronger than my fear of accidents'</p>

<p>Her flat in Hertfordshire is dominated by a multi-gym for early-morning workouts. Also in evidence are two £1,000 sets of Ferrari-red leathers, a hamster called Copper-washer, two huge goldfish, three guitars, an assortment of workshop manuals and a mountain bike.</p>

<p>Parked out the back is a £15,000 Yamaha YZF 750 sports production bike, which she plans to race in the Ulster GP in August.</p>

<p>Since making her first appearance on a 125 in the Italian Championships seven-years ago she has ridden at Brands Hatch, Mallory Park, Snetterton, Cadwell Park and Monza. Three years ago she beat 15 men to win the Italian 750 title.</p>

<p>Now president of the Associazione Difeso Moto, a Milan-based motor-bike racing watchdog, she mixes with the likes of Giacomo Agostini.</p>

<p>"I've had enough success to become more than mere curiosity value for men,' she says. 'But getting sponsorship has been a nightmare. It costs £100,000 to race in a British Championship season. There's been little money to spare but my boyfriend's a mechanic, so that's useful."</p>

<p>She has no plans to marry, follow the career in architecture her studies in Venice decreed or take notice of her father when he asks: "When are you going to stop playing with bikes?"</p>

<p>"I want to ride forever," she says, adding what sounds curiously like "Firsta, pasta, posta!"</p>

<p>IN recent years Kate Parkinson has brought a little bit of glamour to the race tracks of Ireland, a pretty face on a starting grid is a rare thing. If things work out we could be seeing a Latin beauty, TT competitor Francesca Giordano, on the Irish Roads in the not too distant future. Baylon McCaugbey talked to her on the Isle of Man. FRANCESCA Romana Giordano has raced at the TT since 1993, this year she was part of the five-strong female contingent to brave the mountain circuit, the others being Sandra Bamett, Kate Parkinson, and the two Sidecar passengers, Sadie Childs and Kate Harrington. So what brings a sultry Italian beauty to the gruelling TT races? Francesca told me: "The TT races are the most famous in the world, the Island is known as a biker's paradise, that is what attracted me."</p>

<p>Her chance to ride in the TT came about when an Italian journalist heard about the Hailwood Association, who run a scheme that helps bring foreign riders to the Island.</p>

<p>Daughter of an architect, Francesca trained for the same profession before her passion for motorcycles developed. Her first machine was a 500cc Honda which was quickly replaced by a 600 Ducati Pantah. After five laps of the Vallelunga circuit, she was hooked!</p>

<p>Her original involvement in racing brought her many jobs, marshal, race administrator, tyre fitter, just about anything you could think of, Francesca has done it.</p>

<p>When she did go racing, everything did not go well, as she explained: "I had a very bad crash. I was hit by a few following bikes and broke my shoulder and ten ribs. My parents were not too keen on the sport and the crash didn't change that."</p>

<p>But Francesca fought her way back to fitness with the help of Grand Prix doctor, Claudio Costa, after two months in plaster and some physio treatment, she was back in action.</p>

<p>At present, she is the only female competitor in the Italian 750cc series, a challenge she relishes: "The bigger bikes are demanding, so now I do more gym work, and I recently bought a mountain bike to help me delvelop my leg muscles and it's good for my breathing."</p>

<p>Many women at Francesca's age would be thinking of settling down, what are her plans? She said: "I'd be too expensive for a husband to keep, I'd need tyres, petrol, new bikes. Seriously, I prefer my independence. I came to the TT on my own, so I have to be independent. If I was waiting for someone to come and help and they didn't, where would I be, so I just do my own thing."</p>

<p>Despite being busy with bike preparation, Francesca found time to put on her make-up prior to practice which kicked off at 5 am. She had her reasons: "I feel better with make-up on and looking good. I don't want to look like a man, just because I race, doesn't mean I can't be feminine."</p>

<p>Francesca's older sister, Domiziana, is a well known actress, for all you film buffs, she was in 'Interview with a Vampire' with Tom Cruise. Previously Domiziana attracted all the attention, but Francesca's hiking exploits have gained her backing from firms such as Pirelli and fuel giants Agip.</p>

<p>The subject of Irish road racing came up and Francesca is really interested, she said: "I've heard a lot about road racing in Ireland, all your mini-TTs. All the Irish people I have met here have been so friendly, some day I'd like to race in Ireland."</p>

<p>There is a chance that Francesca will be at the Skerries on July 6, Irish Bike has obtained her a machine, but it depends on the promoting club and her schedule. She would certainly be a welcome attraction. At home in Italy, Francesca is president of the Associazione Difesa Moto, set up by herself, an organisation which looks after bikers' interests and encourages riders to get together and socialise, something we could do with more of in Ireland. She must be one busy lady.</p>

<p>For the record Francesca finished the Junior TT on her 600 Yamaha in 68th position, with an average speed of 90.17mph, while she averaged 87.69mph on her 400 Yamaha to take 53rd in the Lightweight. In closing Francesca asked me to thank everyone who helped her in the Isle of Man especially Allan Warner and Corkhills who supplied a car.</p>

<p> RACING round the TT course at 120mph, all the bikers look the same in the blur of speed. It is only in the pits that one of them catches the eye.</p>

<p>When Francesca Giordano takes off her helmet, the cascade of curls proves she is a breed apart from the rest of the field.
Next month, the Italian will tackle one of the most dangerous circuits in the world only two years after vowing to do so. She already has the type of sponsorship deal which makes her the envy of her rivals in the Isle of Man classic. An enthusiastic caravan dealer in Italy has provided her with a camper van to use as a base, while Gloucester Kawasaki will provide her with two bikes.</p>

<p>This Should help ensure she does not repeat last year's flop — when her machine seized up in practice.
Signorina Oiordano is angered by any suggestion that she has had it easy on her route to the top.</p>

<p>"What I've achieved has been through hard work and dedication,' she said. "One of my arms is full of plates and pins from a crash. I've had problems and I've beaten them. 'As far as I am concerned the main advantage of being a female racer is that the men help me lift the bike out of the back of the van.'</p>

<p>She was hooked after taking her Ducati bike to an open day at her local track. One year later she got her big break — literally. She explained: I broke my leg three years ago and with the money I got from the insurance payout and my redundancy money - I'd spent so much time off work that they laid me off - I bought an Aprilia 125 and could afford to go racing full time for a year.</p>

<p>The only thing most Italians know about the race is that it's dangerous. But I was into classic bikes first, so I knew all about it</p>

<p>Two years ago Francesca Giordano decided she wanted to race at the TT. This year she will. She's dedicated, smart and doing a lap with John Westlake</p>

<p>BOUNCING ROUND the TT course in the front of a Transit van, Francesca Romana Giordano does not look glamorous. She's bulging with pullovers because it's February, has her glasses on so she can read the course notes and her flowing locks are stashed away down the back of a paddock jacket. Glamour, sex appeal and a chirpy line in chat got the Italian to the TT - she's got sponsorship most racers only dream of and has had more publicity before the TT than most competitors get during the entire event - but now the work starts.</p>

<p>By the end of the afternoon she must know every bump and bend from Ginger Hall to Ramsey, and in three more days she has to know the 37-mile course like the back of her hair-brush. Being a foxy Italian chick certainly helps get you to the start line of the TT, but it's not much use going into 120mph blind left handers.</p>

<p>Obviously, Francesca knows this. Sitting beside her as she cheerfully mumbles away in Italian about gears and braking points (or something) scribbling more notes to re-read as she re-watches Steve Hislop's flying lap on video over the next few months, you get the impression the sexpot image is a bit of a con, manufactured so male sponsors will pay for her to have an excellent time racing.</p>

<p>This year Cagiva is giving her a Mito 125 to race in the Italian National Women's championship and a Ducati 900SS so she can compete in Italy's Sport Pro-duction class. For the TT Gloucester Kawasaki will provide Francesca with a ZXR400 and ZZ-R600. An enthusiastic caravan dealer in Italy has already given her a large camper van. She came a disappointing fourth last year in Italy's women's championship (blaming an Aprilia that seized seven times during the season) but sponsors couldn't give a stuff, and you can see why. The evening before, she appeared carrying bound copies of all her appearances in the Italian press. There were loads. Then there were the glamorous studio photos shot for sponsors. The last entry was a clipping from the local Manx paper which printed a story about her along with a picture on Gloucester Kawasaki's bike the day before. She is a professional, and if getting sponsorship means flouncing round like Jane Seymour, so be it.</p>

<p>Even when starting out Francesca attracted attention. At her local practice track she wasn't taught the rudiments of racing by a mate who'd already done two races. No, she had lessons from a Mr Biaggi, whose son Max is now a contender for the world 250 GP title. "Yes, Max was always at the track practicing," she says. "He will be 250 champ this year. He's a nice guy too. So's Capirossi, and Gramigni - I see them quite a lot."</p>

<p>As soon as you hint that she's had it easy compared to male racers who aren't chums with world champions and have had to survive without sponsorship, you can see her tense up.</p>

<p>"What I've achieved has been through hard work and dedication," she says waving her arm around the cab. "This [the arm] is full of plates and pins from a crash, and my Aprilia seized seven times in one season - very annoying. I've had problems and I've beaten them. I have raced hard and worked hard so that I could race. As far as I'm concerned, the main advantage of being a female racer is that the men help me lift the bike out of the back of the van."</p>

<p>She got hooked on racing four years ago after taking her Ducati Pantah to a race track open day. "It was fantastic. I wanted to stay there forever. Two weeks later I went to the next open day and I knew I had to go racing." She muddled through for a year, racing when she could, then got her big break.</p>

<p>"I broke my leg in a road bike crash three years ago. With the money I got from the insurance payout and my redundancy money (I'd spent so much time off work that they laid me off) I bought an Aprilia 125 and could afford to go racing full-time for a year."</p>

<p>The following year she read about an Italian journalist competing in the TT. "I immediately wanted to do it. The only thing most Italians know about the race is that it's dangerous, but I was into classic bikes first so I knew all about it. I'd done a few hill climbs which were great - racing on roads made me feel like a naughty schoolboy - but they were too short, so last year I put my Aprilia into the van and drove through Europe to the Isle of Man to compete.</p>

<p> "The first thing I noticed about the circuit was the run-off. There isn't any. Just houses and drops and walls. In Italy I was always complaining that there weren't enough bales here and there wasn't enough run-off there, then I came to the Isle of Man and eeeeeeek." Francesca's bike - that Aprilia - seized going out to practice.</p>

<p>This year she's doing it properly, which means bouncing round the course in a Transit van while team manager and TT racer Allan Warner offers pearls of wisdom like "if you're not really scared, you're not doing it right". "I think she'll do OK," says Allan, who's no slouch on the PR front himself. "She's learning the track fast and we're not putting any pressure on her. Sorry I can't chat - I've got to get her and the bike to a TV interview in half an hour..." <strong>D</strong> </p>

<p> "I always put make-up on; it makes me feel a little better when I race," says Francesca, one of only three female solo riders in the TT. "There is this idea that if you are a woman who races motorbikes you can't be feminine." </p>

<p> As the only woman competing in the 750cc Italian Championship, breaking taboos is something she has been remarkably good at in an unabashedly male-dominated world. She drove from Italy alone in her mobile home to take part in the TT for the third time, racing 400cc and 600cc machines in what she says is "the most famous motorcycle race in the world".</p>

<p> A former architect, she enraged her parents by throwing in a respectable career to work as a grease monkey at the local circuit near Milan, where her passion for motorcycles was inspired at the age of 23.</p>

<p>Aside of racing, she is  also president of the Associa-zione Difesa Moto, which she founded to fight for motorcy- clists' rights. Francesca also directs a bike-geared chat show called the Bike Drawing Room on Italian regional television. For now, though, sheis keen to promote women as road racers.</p>

<p> "There is no reason why more women can't race," she says. "After all, a motorcycle doesn't a sex at all, does it?" </p>

<p>Francesca Giordano races hard and takes her crashes lightiy. She explains why to Anthea Hail DESPITE her protestations otherwise, not everyone welcomes Francesca Giordano, the glamour-puss of the Tourist Trophy (TT) races on the Isle of Man. This year, she is the only female competitor on the 400cc and 600cc machines, and a looker with it.</p>

<p>It had been raining continually but Francesca's curly hair still looked good as she posed for photographs with her Kawasaki motorbike. A middle-aged Italian, on the bogus pretext that his van could not get past, jumped out and removed her carefully placed bike with a torrent of abuse. Five minutes later, another older man parked between Francesca and the photographer for a pointedly long greeting to an old friend.</p>

<p>Francesca, used to posing, shrugged it off. After all, she has a film star sister, Domiziana, who co-starred with the great Alain Delon in Nouvelle: Vague, so why not a little limelight for Francesca? Anyway there are enough real hazards to worry about. </p>

<p>The next day, for example, during the early morning practice run on the 37-mile course. Francesca took acorner too fast, slid 60 yards across the road, hit a wall, slid another 10 yards and had to be removed, unconscious, from under her Kawasaki and taken to hospital. Three hours later she emerged in a neck-brace, reluctantly accepting her team manager's instructions not to ride again that day. </p>

<p>This week Francesca, 31, will twice embark on the world's greatest motorcycling challenge; On Monday she will set off on the mountain circuit on a 400cc Kawasaki and on Wednesday, if she is still intact, on a 600cc model.</p>

<p>Dozens of people have been killed attempting the circuit during the 80-odd years of TT racing. The dangers are pin-pointed by thousands of straw bales dotted around the island protecting telegraph poles, stone walls, trees and other possible crashing points. Ballacraine Hotel, on a strategic corner, which George Formby rode into in the film No Limit is barracaded by a pile of bales. </p>

<p>The roads, including deregulated 30 mph speed limits through villages, are treated as a long one-way street for the race. Competitors roar past as close as possible to beer drinkers at outside pub tables, which makes it the ultimate spectator sport. </p>

<p>Francesca is making the most of her week on the island before the race, learning every bend, bump, and manhole cover of the course by ordnance survey map, watching hair-raising videos shot from motorbike handle-bars, and by doing the course as often as she can for the practice hours at dawn and dusk when the route is officially closed to all but race competitors.</p>

<p>Allan Warner, Francesca's team manager for Gloucester Kawasaki, also takes herself   round the course by car. His commentary is remorseless: "Cut in dead tight to the bank, keeping looking at the bank. At the moment, you're going into the corner and looking for the exit. If you do that, you'll drive into the bank. Keep looking at the near side and you'll come out with three foot to spare..." Francesca absorbs it all. After he described in detail a particularly nasty crash, Francesca merely asks: "Were you in fourth or fifth gear?"</p>

<p>She knows all about crashing. Two years ago she broke 10 ribs, the radius and the ulna in her left forearm, her left scapula: a total of 20 fractures. This kept her in hospital for one month, in plaster for two, and in physiotherapy for a third.The next month she she was back on the track  and crashed (relatively harmlessly) again.</p>

<p>What is the allure, the compulsion? Francesca has no simple answer. From the age of 14, she said, when she had her first Vespa, she would borrow "real" bikes from friends. As she grow older and her bikes became bigger, one of her special delights was to roar along the old streets of Rome setting off a trail of car burglar alarms. She likes speed, she adores the smell of petrol and motor oil, especially Castrol R, which is used in two-stroke engine fuel: "When I smell it I think 'Delicious ... a two-stroke bike!' "</p>

<p>The greatest thrill, she says, is when the bike turns a corner. "How do you call it? Banking. When the ground comes up very close and you feel the speed."</p>

<p>"I don't know whether other women resent my interest in racing. I don't have any women friends. It seems normal to have guys around me. Most of my friends are mechanics and bike enthusiasts."</p>

<p>Francesca can tune an engine and change tyres, though actually wheeling the large, heavy bike on to the circuit is such hard work for her it seems impossible that someone so slight can race it. She says when she first started racing it hurt her thighs so much that it made her cry: "Now I exercise in the gym for two hours a day and my muscles have got used to it.</p>

<p>"You don't really think about danger - certainly not when you know you are doing well. And when you're going really fast, flat out on the straight, that's the moment you relax, lie forward on the tank and take a deep breath. That's the easy time, not when you're going more slowly round a corner." The reason why more women do not race, she said, is nothing more than social conditioning.</p>

<p>"Also, girls are conditioned not to get into dangerous situations. But like religion, being brought up a Catholic, once they start thinking about it they come out of it.</p>

<p>"It is a shame because, in theory, women have the advantage of being smaller, weighing less and being agile.</p>

<p>"But this social conditioning can be overcome. Last year, my parents finally gave up asking me whether I had stopped playing with bikes."</p>

<p>The annual pilgrimage to the Isle of Man for the TT races is in full swing, with bikes and bikers everywhere. By Alasdair Reid</p>

<p>ON TUESDAY afternoon, the mist came down on Snaefell, the highest mountain on the Isle of Man, and settled into its folds like a damp, discarded blanket. This is the cloak of Manannan, drawn over the island to hide it from foreign invaders, yet while a thousand years of Manx independence suggest that the Celtic sea god once knew what he was doing, these days he seems to be fighting a losing battle. </p>

<p>On the sea front at Douglas, the invaders were gathering in their thousands. A two-wheeled army of pilgrimage, undeterred by such sombre camouflage or the prospect of hotels where elegance is mostly of the faded variety. A multi-national throng, too,  pouring from the ferry King Orry to pay homage to legends of their own. </p>

<p>The Manx authorities call their island the road-race capital of the world, yet even in practice week their claim seemed flawed by an excess of modesty. As sacred as they are celebrated, the 37.73 miles of its Tourist Trophy circuit ? formed by the simple expedient of closing a few public roads ? lure 500 competitors and 40,000 spectators every year, drawn, by a beguiling mixture of history, tradition and the purity of the sport. To think of it merely as a sporting venue is to miss the point by a distance.</p>

<p>You only have to drive round the course once to appreciate that the roadside marker boards form the most evocative gazetteer in motorcycle racing. West. out of Douglas, the road takes you past Braddon Bridge and Crosby then north from Ballacraine. Past Cronk-y-Voddy, Ballaugh Bridge and Selby, it then loops south from Ramsey over the famous Mountain section. The ascent is relatively gentle, but the downward sweep is a furious and exhilarating charge through the bends of Windy Corner and Creg-ny-Baa and on to Governor's Bridge, the last of the circuit's 264 corners on the entry to the finishing straight. </p>

<p>By any measure, not least the fact that it has claimed around able whether such a creature really exists, for outside the select few stars, the rest of the TT field is drawn from an impressively wide range of backgrounds and nationalities, enthusiasm being their only common factor. Behind the grandstand are a handful of works teams with their motor-homes and liveried lorries, but the most common transport by  far is the hired van of the privateer.</p>

<p>Clearly, part of the appeal of the TT is that it forms such a broad church. Yet this is an institution founded on democratic principles where, in a paddock mercifully free of the caste systems found in other forms of motorsport, it takes an expert eye to distinguish the established hero from the optimistic newcomer. While other forssuffer from cynical elitism, road racing is still a healthy meritocracy, its machinery more closely based on production machines and its stars almost invariably people's champions, hailed for their expertise on roads that are open to everyone else almost every day of they year.</p>

<p>Joey Dunlop, the Honda works rider from Ballymoney who will be trying to extend his record of 19 TT wins in four races this week, is feted as much for his background as a lorry driver and steel erector as his mastery of a course he can lap at around. 120mph. Likewise Mike Hailwood, who was acclaimed not only for his astonishing win, but for his loyalty, when he returned to race on the island in 1979, when grand prix stars like Sheene and Agostini turned their backs on the event.</p>

<p>"The TT is the most beautiful race in the world," says Giordano. "It's what every motorcyclist would like to do - going as fast as possible on the road. When you ride here you find that all the world has come to watch the races. You know of the famous people who have raced here before. Every part of the island has a story and you feel that you are a part of it. It's very fascinating, more than just a race."</p>

<p>While the course itself inspires awe and respect among riders, it angers Giordano that its killer reputation has been bolstered by recklessness, both of TT followers, who have tried to match their speeds, and by press coverage that has failed to distinguish their deaths from those of real racers. Jack Wood, clerk of the course and a TT rider in the 1950s, understands the allure, but cautions newcomers against excess.</p>

<p>"Here you've got to be a thinking rider, very much so, because of the nature of the course. With hedges and walls and all the rest of it, it's a course not to fall off on. A lot of the kerbs are chamfered, but everything beyond that is a danger area. It's a hard course and it takes time to learn and it's unusual for anyone to go well on his first year."</p>

<p>"If someone is going fast we'd be worried about it, we'd be talking to him about it in fact. We'd want to know if he realised he was on the TT course and if he really knew what he was doing. The pleasure of riding here is so great that you can get obsessed with it and forget about other factors. We just like to stop them and make them think."</p>

<p>The charm of the Isle of Man is mirrored by a course, and weather conditions, of beguiling variety. This week, as the riders blast away from the startline, head down Bray Hill and over Quarter Bridge, they will say a quiet prayer for a circuit free of Mannanan's cloak, or any other shroud.</p>
